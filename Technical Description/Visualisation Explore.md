# Visualisation Methods

## 1. D3.js

### [1] What is D3.js

[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is a **JavaScript** library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

## 2. Vega

### [1] What is Vega

[Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) is a visualization grammar, a declarative language for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. With Vega, you can describe the visual appearance and interactive behavior of a visualization in a **JSON** format, and generate web-based views using Canvas or SVG.

### [2] Vega and D3.js ([source](https://vega.github.io/vega/about/vega-and-d3/))

Comparing with D3.js, Vega:

- Support customizable designs.
- Make visualizations more reusable and shareable.
- Enable programmatic generation of visualizations.
- Improve performance and platform flexibility.

## 3. Vega-Lite

### [1] Different from Vega

[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) is a concise language for rapidly creating interactive visualizations. Vega-Lite specifications compile to full-blown Vega specifications. Though expressive and performant, Vega can still require verbose specifications: control flow is handled by the model, but the logic of event and data processing must be explicitly provided. As a result, Vega is not an ideal language for people to quickly author interactive plots in the midst of an analysis session. Vega-Lite focuses on rapid creation of common statistical graphics. Vega-Lite specifications are typically an order-of-magnitude smaller than corresponding Vega specifications. Compared to existing high-level grammars, Vega-Lite includes novel constructs for interaction techniques and multi-view displays.
